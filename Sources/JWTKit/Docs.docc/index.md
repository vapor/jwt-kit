# ``JWTKit``

JWTKit is a Swift library for working with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). It implements the [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) specification with support for RSA, ECDSA, EdDSA and HMAC signatures. It also provides support for the [JWK](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) and [JWS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) specifications.

There are helpers for working with Apple, Google, and Microsoft JWTs.
